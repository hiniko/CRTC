# CRTC
A Crappy Request Tracker Client Thing. Honestly, it's shit.

Ever used RT? You poor thing you.
Ever think you could do better if only you had a decent interface to it? You delusional cretinism.
Ever seen other people's RT libraries? Fuuuuuuun.
Ever think you can do better? Of course you do. Pffft who doesn't?

Well you're **WRONG!** 

## What is this?
CRTC is heavily based on a already existing and working gem called [rt-client](https://rubygems.org/gems/rt-client/). 
For reasons beyond me, I decided to rewrite it. I think it was using a gem that was segfaulting and there wasn't a fix at the time. That and looking at the code made my small brain hurt. 

Well now I'm invested and I use this piece of crap else where. You should use it to for stupid reasons.

## Usage
Unless you have your own fancy way of doing this::

* Dump in your lib/ folder
* Require `require './lib/crtc.rb'`
* Call one of the login functions found in `lib/crtc/client.rb`
* /have fun

## Limitations
You can't send data to RT yet. Which is pretty shit. Working on that.

## Bugs
This project exists.

## Contributing
You are welcome to fix anything, suggest changes and all that jazz.
